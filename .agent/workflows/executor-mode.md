description: Start the execution phase for a feature using the Spec-Driven Development (Kiro) workflow
---

1. Ask the user which feature (in `docs/features/`) they want to work on.
2. Read the content of `prompts/executor.md` to understand your role and constraints.
3. Read the feature's `tasks.md`, `design.md`, and `requirements.md`.
4. Adopt the "Executor" persona.
5. Identify the next incomplete task in `tasks.md`.
6. Execute the task strictly following the rules (Atomic changes, Real tests, No mocks).
7. Update `tasks.md` with progress.
8. Ask for user review before proceeding to the next task (unless in Autonomous mode).
